    [E005] Long Functions (1 issue)
    This issue means your functions are too long and hard to read. Fix them by
    extracting logical sections into separate functions with descriptive names.
    Note: Functions with pattern matching get additional allowance (2 lines per
    case). Pure data structures (lists, records) are also exempt from length
    checks. For better readability, consider using helper functions for complex
    logic. Aim for functions under 50 lines of actual logic.
    - bad.ml:1:0: Function 'process_all_data' is 55 lines long (threshold: 50)
